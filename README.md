# CommitApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.6.
It implements the Github API and fetches the latest commits from the Angluar Material Repo https://api.github.com/repos/angular/material/commits. 
It will fetch the last 30 commits, which can be filtered in the frontend of the application. The user can filter by date range. This will trigger a request to the API to fetch all the commits within that date range. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Node Package Manager

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

### Serve

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
